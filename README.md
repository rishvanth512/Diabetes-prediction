Libraries used :
Numpy: Numpy library is used for using mathematical functions in arrays. It uses ndarray(n-dimensional array) with powerful methods to operate on it. It increases the accuracy as compared to normal arrays and mathematical functions.

Pandas:
Pandas is used for analysing and operating on data. It is used to get a brief introduction on the data and decide on what next steps to follow. Mean, maximum , minimum values can be found out

Scikit learn(Sklearn):
Sklearn library is used for various functions such as supervised and unsupervised learning and is extremely important for machine learning algorithms. We have used train_test_split for splitting data, accuracy score for finding out the accuracy and various machine learning models.

Seaborn 
Seaborn library is used for making graphs from the given data. It is very important library for the data visualization process.
